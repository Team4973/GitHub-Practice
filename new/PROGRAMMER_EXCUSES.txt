CATEGORY: TESTS
---------------

CATEGORY: GIT ISSUES
--------------------

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
• Always blame caching first
• When in doubt, blame DNS second  
• If all else fails, blame JavaScript
• Never say "I don't know" - say "That's an interesting edge case"
• "I'll create a ticket for that" = the graveyard of good intentions

LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This handbook is satire. Please actually fix your bugs,
write tests, and document your code. Your future self will thank you.
(But your current self is probably too busy "refactoring" to care.)
