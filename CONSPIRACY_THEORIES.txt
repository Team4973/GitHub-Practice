TOP SECRET CONSPIRACY THEORIES
================================
(100% Real, Trust Me Bro)

1. BIRDS AREN'T REAL
   - All birds were replaced with government surveillance drones in 1987
   - "Bird poop" is actually tracking gel
   - That's why birds sit on power lines - they're recharging
   - Pigeons = basic model, owls = night vision cameras

2. THE MOON IS CHEESE
   - NASA has been covering this up since 1969
   - Armstrong's first words were edited - he actually said "That's one small bite for man"
   - This is why we haven't gone back - we ate too much last time
   - Craters are just where mice have been nibbling

3. FINLAND DOESN'T EXIST
   - It's actually just water and a conspiracy between Japan and Russia
   - "Finnish" people are paid actors
   - Nokia phones were made in Eastern Sweden
   - Santa lives in Northern Sweden, not Finland (because Finland isn't real)

4. GIRAFFES ARE A HOAX
   - Too tall to be real, obviously
   - Invented by zoos to sell more tickets
   - Long horses? Come on, that's ridiculous
   - Have YOU ever seen a baby giraffe? Exactly.

5. REDDIT KARMA IS A CRYPTOCURRENCY
   - The government farms it through bot accounts
   - Upvotes are blockchain transactions
   - This is why Reddit is down so often - crypto mining
   - Moderators are actually IRS agents

6. AUSTRALIA IS A LIE
   - It's a cover-up for where Britain sent its criminals (the ocean)
   - "Australians" are crisis actors hired by the Map Industrial Complex
   - All photos are CGI
   - Kangaroos? Please. Next you'll say drop bears are real.

REMEMBER: Question everything. Especially this file.

   7. HORSES ARENT REAL
   - there is no solid historical evidince of "horses"
   - have you ever seen a baby "horse"?
   - they are cyborgs made by the government, the same department that makes the "birds"
   - "horses" are made by the government so they can cush rebellions if needed.
